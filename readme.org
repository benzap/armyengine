* About
  
  ArmyEngine was written to be simple and modular, and was developed
  in order to get a better understanding of design principles behind
  game design.

  The basic game design pattern used to develop this engine was the
  Entity-Component-System pattern. The full approach is outlined in
  this article [[http://piemaster.net/2011/07/entity-component-artemis/]]

  For a basic understanding, the engine consists of entities, and
  these entities are assigned components that describe what those
  entities can do.
